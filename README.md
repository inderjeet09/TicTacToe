## Description

The TicTacToe Web Game is a classic game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provides a web-based version of the popular Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to achieve a winning pattern.

The project structure includes the following components:

- `index.html`: This file contains the HTML code for the game interface.

Inside the `TicTacToe` folder, you will find the following subfolders:

1. `scripts` folder: This folder contains the JavaScript files responsible for the game's functionality.
   - `app.js`: This file defines variables and function calls using event listeners to handle user interactions.
   - `config.js`: This file contains the function logic required for setting up the game playing environment before starting a game.
   - `game.js`: This file contains the game logic, including changing player turns, checking for a winner, and displaying the game result.

2. `styles` folder: This folder contains the CSS files responsible for styling different sections of the game.
   - `configuration.css`: This file defines the styling for the configuration section of the game.
   - `game.css`: This file contains the styling rules for the game board and its elements.
   - `overlays.css`: This file provides styling for overlays and pop-up messages.
   - `styles.css`: This file contains general styles that are applied throughout the game.
